'NOTES:
'1. This works by taking the first item in the array and getting its RAM memory pointer, then takes the same for the last item.
'2. The two addresses are subtracted to determine how many bytes are between the two points, since arrays can't be fragmented in memory.
'3. Return value is in Bytes
